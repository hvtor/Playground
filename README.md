<h2>Reverse String</h2>

<h3> Write a method that takes a string reverses the order of the words in that string and returns the result.
</h3>
This was fairly simple. Make a function that reverses a string. I added a parameter, then set a constant of reverseString. Because I separated the string into characters, I had to cast the array of characters, back into a string. Totally legal :)

<h2>Fibonacci Number 

</h2><h3> Write a method that takes in integer n and returns the value at the nth position of the fibonacci sequence.
</h3>
Here's a list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.  Try to keep the number you entered low, because this is a recursive function, it can really spin up your CPU.  I'm going to try a more optimized method using Binet's Fibonacci Number Formula.
